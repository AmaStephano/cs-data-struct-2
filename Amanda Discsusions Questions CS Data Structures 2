Recursion

1. In your own words, what is recursion?
	It is a method of breaking a problem down into smaller problems until you hit the base case. This involves a function calling itself over and over again.   


2. Why is it necessary to have a base case?
	A base case determines when to stop calling the function. If you didn't have this, you would have a infinite loop.  


Graphs

1. What is a graph?
	A graph represents relationships between nodes. They can be directed of non-directed. They can contain loops. Trees are a special kind of graph.

2. How is a graph different from a tree?
	A Tree is a special kind of graph. There can only be once path between any two nodes. This means there cannot be "loops."
	
3. Give an example of something that would be good to model with a graph.
	Facebook friends or LinkedIn connections because there can be more than one way you are connected with someone.
